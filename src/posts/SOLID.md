SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID principles are:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility.
It encourages designing classes that have a clear and singular purpose.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
It promotes the idea that you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its source code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
It ensures that a derived class can be substituted for its base class without altering the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
It advises breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones to avoid forcing clients to implement methods they don't need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
It encourages the use of abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level and low-level components.
These principles aim to guide developers in creating more modular, flexible, and maintainable software by promoting good design practices. Applying SOLID principles often leads to code that is easier to understand, extend, and maintain over time.
